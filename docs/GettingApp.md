# Getting a Mobile Wallet

Use these instructions to get a compatible mobile app on your phone that can receive, hold and prove your verifiable credentials. There are currently at least three options that you can try: [BC Wallet](#bc-wallet), [esatus](#esatus-wallet) and [Lissi](https://lissi.id/).

## BC Wallet

The [BC Wallet](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/government-id/bc-wallet) is
an wallet for holding verifiable credentials built on top of
[Aries Bifold](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-mobile-agent-react-native) and published by
the Government of British Columbia for both iOS and Android. To use BC Gov Digital Identity
and Trust apps you just need to install the wallet and follow the initialization instructions.

Links to download the BC Wallet and more information about the wallet are available on the [BC Wallet] page.
